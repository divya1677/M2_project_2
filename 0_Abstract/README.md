PROJECT TITLE :DIGITAL THERMOMETER USING MICROCONTROLLER


* Objective:

Sometimes people find it difficult to read temperature from analog thermometer because of fluctuations. So here we are going to build a simple Digital thermometer using 8051 microcontroller in which voltage source is used for measuring the temperature and a lcd is used for display.

What are digital thermometers used for?

Digital thermometers offer an extremely wide range of uses in day-to-day professional and home applications. They provide accuracy and speed of temperature reading in almost any situation that a traditional thermometer would do, as well as being ideally suited to a great many scenarios in which liquid-in-glass versions would be unsuitable.

A digital thermometer is used to verify a smart temperature transmitter under flowing conditions and a successful calibration of the smart temperature transmitter. Portable electronic thermometers (PETs) are designed to measure temperature in a RTD-type thermowell using a thermistor or RTD probe. The thermometer should be approved for use in hazardous locations, Class 1, Groups C and D. The thermometer should be furnished with suitably coated probe cables at least 6 inches long. The digital display should be easily read in direct sunlight and equipped with a backlight (optional) for night operations. The display shall have a resolution to at least XX.XX°F.

The PET should be compared to a certified partial immersion thermometer on a daily basis at room temperature to ensure the performance at the start of each workday. A log of the daily verifications associated with each PET should be keep to provide an audit trail and ensure accuracy of the portable device. If the error at any point exceeds ±0.10°F, calibrate the portable device or return the PET to the supplier. The digital thermometer should be capable of field calibration.

* Applications:

1)Medical Applications: The digital thermometers are used to measure human body temperature around 37⁰C. These thermometers are mostly probe type or ear type. It measures   oral, rectal, and armpit body temperature.

2)Marine Applications: Digital thermometers with a high-temperature exhaust gas sensor as the temperature sensor can be used in marine applications for measuring the       local temperature.

3)Industrial Applications: Digital thermometers are also used in power plants, nuclear power plants, blast furnaces, shipbuilding industries, etc. They can measure         temperature from -220⁰C to +850⁰C.

ADVANTAGES:

1.Temperatures may be read quickly and accurately using digital thermometers.

2.They're small and portable, and you can even keep the thermometer in your backpack.

3.It's simple to read the display.

4.A digital thermometer is reasonably priced.

5.They do not need any particular care.

DISADVANTAGES:

1.Digital thermometers have the disadvantage of having dead batteries.

2.Submerging a conventional thermometer in warm, soapy water is simple, but doing it with a digital thermometer is more complicated.

3.Some digital thermometers are more accurate than others.

FUTURE SCOPE:

The global Digital Thermometers market is anticipated to rise at a considerable rate during the forecast period 2021 to 2027. In 2021,

CONCLUSION:

The Digital Thermometer that we made is working properly with a good accuracy.
