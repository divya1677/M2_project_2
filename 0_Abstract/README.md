PROJECT TITLE :DIGITAL THERMOMETER USING MICROCONTROLLER


* Objective:

Sometimes people find it difficult to read temperature from analog thermometer because of fluctuations. So here we are going to build a simple Digital thermometer using 8051 microcontroller in which voltage source is used for measuring the temperature and a lcd is used for display.

What are digital thermometers used for?

Digital thermometers offer an extremely wide range of uses in day-to-day professional and home applications. They provide accuracy and speed of temperature reading in almost any situation that a traditional thermometer would do, as well as being ideally suited to a great many scenarios in which liquid-in-glass versions would be unsuitable.


* Applications:

1)Medical Applications: The digital thermometers are used to measure human body temperature around 37⁰C. These thermometers are mostly probe type or ear type. It measures   oral, rectal, and armpit body temperature.

2)Marine Applications: Digital thermometers with a high-temperature exhaust gas sensor as the temperature sensor can be used in marine applications for measuring the       local temperature.

3)Industrial Applications: Digital thermometers are also used in power plants, nuclear power plants, blast furnaces, shipbuilding industries, etc. They can measure         temperature from -220⁰C to +850⁰C.
