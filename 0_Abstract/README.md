PROJECT TITLE :DIGITAL THERMOMETER USING MICROCONTROLLER


*/Objective:

Sometimes people find it difficult to read temperature from analog thermometer because of fluctuations. So here we are going to build a simple Digital thermometer using 8051 microcontroller in which voltage source is used for measuring the temperature and a lcd is used for display.

Applications:

Medical Applications: The digital thermometers are used to measure human body temperature around 37⁰C. These thermometers are mostly probe type or ear type. It measures oral, rectal, and armpit body temperature.

Marine Applications: Digital thermometers with a high-temperature exhaust gas sensor as the temperature sensor can be used in marine applications for measuring the local temperature.

Industrial Applications: Digital thermometers are also used in power plants, nuclear power plants, blast furnaces, shipbuilding industries, etc. They can measure temperature from -220⁰C to +850⁰C.
