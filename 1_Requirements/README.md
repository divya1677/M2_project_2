                                      Digital Thermometer using 8051 Microcontroller

Digital Thermometer using 8051 Microcontroller is a simple project where temperature is diplayed in digital form. 

Traditional systems were confusing

These techniques are an integration of mechanical and electronic devices and are highly intelligent. One of the prominent features of these DIGITAL THERMOMETER is their simplicity and high efficiency.

Here, we developed an 
Digital thermometer using 8051 microcontroller (Sometimes people find it difficult to read temperature from analog thermometer because of fluctuations SO THIS DEVICE MAKES EASIER TO READ TEMPERATURE)
* ADVANTAGES OF USING DIGITAL THERMOMETER

1)Temperatures may be read quickly and accurately using digital thermometers.
2)They're small and portable, and you can even keep the thermometer in your backpack.
3)It's simple to read the display.
4)A digital thermometer is reasonably priced.
5)They do not need any particular care.  

1)Hardware Requirements

* Components Required:                          
* 8051 MICRO CONTROLLER
* 16*2 LCD display
* VOLTAGE SOURCE



2)Software Requirements 
* SIMULIDE
* MICROCHIP STUDIO OR KEIL 

Strengths: Innovative, User-friendly.
           Temperatures may be read quickly 
           They're small and portable, 
           It's simple to read the display.
           A digital thermometer is reasonably priced.
           They do not need any particular care.

Weakness: Digital thermometers have the disadvantage of having dead batteries.
          Submerging a conventional thermometer in warm, soapy water is simple, but doing it with a digital thermometer is more complicated.
          
Opportunities:This project provides innovative way for displaying temperature

Where: MEDICAL,MARINE

When : Measuring temperature
