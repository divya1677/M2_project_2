                                      Password Based Door Lock System using 8051 Microcontroller

Password Based Door Lock System using 8051 Microcontroller is a simple project where a secure password will act as a door unlocking system. 

Traditional lock systems using mechanical lock and key mechanism are being replaced by new advanced techniques of locking system.

These techniques are an integration of mechanical and electronic devices and are highly intelligent. One of the prominent features of these innovative lock systems is their simplicity and high efficiency.

Such an automatic lock system consists of electronic control assembly, which controls the output load through a password. 

This output load can be a motor or a lamp or any other mechanical/electrical load.

Here, we developed an electronic code lock system using 8051 microcontroller (a Password based Door Lock System using 8051 Microcontroller), which provides control to the actuating the load. It is a simple embedded system with input from the keyboard and the output being actuated accordingly.

This system demonstrates a Password based Door Lock System using 8051 Microcontroller, wherein once the correct code or password is entered, the door is opened and the concerned person is allowed access to the secured area. Again, if another person arrives, it will ask to enter the password. If the password is wrong, then door would remain closed, denying access to the person.

1)Hardware Requirements

* 8051 Microcontroller
* 8051 Development Board
* 8051 Programmer
* 4×4 Matrix Keypad
* 16×2 LCD
* L293D Motor Driver Board
* DC Motor
* 10KΩ Potentiometer

2)Software Requirements 
* SIMULIDE

Strengths: Innovative, User-friendly.

Weakness: If you forget the password it is not possible to open the door.
          It is a low range circuit, i.e. it is not possible to operate the circuit remotely.

Opportunities:This project provides security

Where: School, Science, domestic, industries, Technology
