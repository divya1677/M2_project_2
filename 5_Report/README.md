Introduction: 
A digital thermometer is used to verify a smart temperature transmitter under flowing conditions and a successful calibration of the smart temperature transmitter. Portable electronic thermometers (PETs) are designed to measure temperature in a RTD-type thermowell using a thermistor or RTD probe.The thermometer should be approved for use in hazardous locations, Class 1, Groups C and D. The thermometer should be furnished with suitably coated probe cables at least 6 inches long. The digital display should be easily read in direct sunlight and equipped with a backlight (optional) for night operations. 

There are various different kinds of modern digital thermometer sensors, among the most common of which is a type called a ‘resistance temperature detector’ (RTD). This sort of thermometer works on the principle that the electrical resistance of metal changes with temperature.

What are digital thermometers used for?

Digital thermometers offer an extremely wide range of uses in day-to-day professional and home applications. They provide accuracy and speed of temperature reading in almost any situation that a traditional thermometer would do, as well as being ideally suited to a great many scenarios in which liquid-in-glass versions would be unsuitable.

* APPLICATIONS OF DIGITAL THERMOMETER
* Food probe digital thermometers
To ensure thorough and even cooking, food probe thermometers need to be accurate, and to offer quickly repeatable temperature readings in multiple different areas of food undergoing production or preparation. They must be hygienic and easily sanitised between uses to prevent bacteria build-up or transfer, and often include colour-coding options to help with this.

* Industrial digital thermometers
Products intended for industrial use tend to be more ruggedly constructed and suitable for use in a range of potentially challenging or hazardous environments. They may be designed to fit with multiple different probe types, including thermistors and thermocouples, and will often include additional features such as countdown timers, rubberised IP-rated housings, backlit displays and non-sparking material constructions.

* Central heating and HVAC digital thermometers
HVAC and central heating applications are one of the most common industrial and engineering environments in which digital thermometers are routinely used. HVAC digital thermometers are most commonly used to measure air, water, copper line and refrigerant temperatures, and must be extremely accurate as a single degree change can lead to compliance failures or equipment damage.
* Scientific digital thermometers

* Types of digital thermometers
1)Digital thermometers for cars and autos
2)Differential digital thermometers
3)Wall-mounted digital thermometers
4)Wireless digital thermometers

Project Objective: 
people find it difficult to read temperature from analog thermometer because of fluctuations. So here we are going to build a simple Digital thermometer using 8051 microcontroller 

we are trying to obtain these goals from this project
* Temperatures may be read quickly and accurately using digital thermometers.
* It's simple to read the display.

DESCRIPTION OF COMPONENTS

* MICROCONTROLLER
8051 microcontroller is a 8 bit microcontroller which has 128 bytes of on chip RAM , 4K bytes of on chip ROM, two timers, one serial port and four 8bit ports. 8052 microcontroller is an extension of microcontroller. The table below shows the comparison of 8051 family members.

* 16x2 LCD:
16*2 LCD is a widely used display for embedded applications. Here is the brief explanation about pins and working of 16*2 LCD display. There are two very important registers inside the LCD. They are data register and command register. Command register is used to send commands such as clear display, cursor at home etc., data register is used to send data which is to be displayed on 16*2 LCD. 
 * CAPACITOR
 A capacitor is a device that stores electrical energy in an electric field. It is a passive electronic component with two terminals.

* CLOCK
 In electronics and especially synchronous digital circuits, a clock signal (historically also known as logic beat) oscillates between a high and a low state and is used like a metronome to coordinate actions of digital circuits. A clock signal is produced by a clock generator.

* FIXED VOLTAGE
 A fixed voltage type is a variable voltage type that integrates the external resistor.

* GROUND
In electronics and electrical engineering, it is by convention we define a point in a circuit as a reference point. This reference point is known as ground (or GND) and carries a voltage of 0V.

* ADVANTAGES:

  1. Temperatures may be read quickly and accurately using digital thermometers.
 
  2.They're small and portable, and you can even keep the thermometer in your backpack.

  3.It's simple to read the display.

  4.A digital thermometer is reasonably priced.

  5.They do not need any particular care.


* DISADVANTAGES: 

  1.Digital thermometers have the disadvantage of having dead batteries.

  2.Submerging a conventional thermometer in warm, soapy water is simple, but doing it with a digital thermometer is more complicated.

  3.Some digital thermometers are more accurate than others.

FUTURE SCOPE:

The global Digital Thermometers market is anticipated to rise at a considerable rate during the forecast period 2021 to 2027. In 2021,
